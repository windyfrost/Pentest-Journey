I feel that OSCP is definitely hard, not for beginners like me. (Even had a comp science friend who only scored 10 bonus points in the whole sitting.)

23 hours 45 minutes may seem like a lot of time but trust me, it is very mentally draining to pentest all machines during the whole frametime and frustration comes when you cannot proceed to next process either because you did not enumerate enough, exploit does not work, technical issues, etc.

You need to understand basic network theories, like how internet works? how computers communicate?
You definitely need to know your common ports eg; FTP 21, SSH 22, HTTP 80

OSCP exam revolves largely on port 80 attacks for enumeration, so you need to know what to look out for (make sure you know your SQL injection, path traversal, XSS attack, directory fuzzing, different kinds of revshells etc) If you have not heard of any of this, abort mission.


The high level summary on process of the exam revolves around enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, lateral movement to reach the objective of getting root.

Splitting the exam into three separate parts - Active Directory, Standalone Machines and Report Writing
Using kali(Linux, Debian) as your default machine, you are to intrude into Windows Domain Controller and Linux machines and document the process and methodology used to achieve root privileges.
