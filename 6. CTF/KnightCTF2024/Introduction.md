This is my very first CTF to date. It has been an amazing experience for me as I managed to solve several questions on digital forensics as well as steganography.

I was doing this with a team of 3, and we got 165th ranking out of 734.

This repository serves as an entry of writeups that I managed to retrieve - for both questions I solved and did not solve.



Enjoy ~
Let's keep learning.
