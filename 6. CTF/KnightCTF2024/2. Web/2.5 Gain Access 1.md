## Steps:

1. Go to the target URL:  ```http://45.33.123.243:13556/index.php``` (We see a login page.)
2. SQLi is not possible so lets take a look at source code

3. Keep scrolling down until we see a comment on line 311:

4. We have the e-mail address for the login. Since UI does not allow SQLi, we will do this manually with URL encoding, double dash ```--``` means comment and ```+``` means space respectively. We will login as ```root@knightctf[.]com``` and  comment to bypass password login, with a space.

Open up burpsuite, send the page to Repeater and edit the parameters over there. Once done, select on Send.
