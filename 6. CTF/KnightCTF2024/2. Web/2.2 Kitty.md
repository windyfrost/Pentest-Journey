## Steps:

1. Go to the target URL:  ```http://45.33.123.243:5020/``` (We see a login page.)
2. SQLi is the first that comes into mind so lets do this: 
 
```
Username: " or 1=1-- -
Password: " or 1=1-- -
```

Line 42 - 71 is a coding script, and line 47 basically says if the post input start with 'cat flag.txt then it will respond by posting a hidden flag post or else any other inputs will just be adding onto the dashboard.

5. Let's input ```cat flag.txt```
6. Then we get the flag:
