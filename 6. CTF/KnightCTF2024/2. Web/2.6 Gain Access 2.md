## Steps:

1. Go to the target URL:  ```https://gain-access-2.knightsquad.org``` (We see a login page.)

2. Lets understand the webpage more by looking at source code with view-source

![[2.6.2.png]]

And scroll down until there is a comment on line 517 which introduced a hidden directory containing a notesssssss.txt file

3. Lets go over to the text file, this appears to be a hash

4. Run hash-identifier and this looks like its MD5 hash

5. Since running on hashcat with rockyou and best64 rule exhausts the wordlist, lets look for other alternatives to crack this MD5 hash

Crackstation was unable to decrypt the MD5 hash

md5hashing.net managed to decrypt the MD5 value: letmein_kctf2024

6. Lets try to log in with the credentials root @knightctf.com:letmein_kctf2024

![[2.6.10.png]]

7. At this point, 2FA.php appear asking for OTP. Lets try SQLi to bypass

8. Looks like we managed to bypass the 2FA successfully because URL arrived at dashboard.php, but Flag Vanished.

![[2.6.13.png]]

Further results from burpsuite confirmed that its true, from the response of process_2fa.php

![[2.6.14.png]]

9. Now that we can log in and bypass the 2FA, we will intercept the request to go on dashboard.php - flag should show

## Flag: KCTF{Fram3S_n3vE9_L1e_4_toGEtH3R}
